ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Prediction App

A simple Streamlit web application that predicts the species of an Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

ðŸ“Œ Features

User-friendly sliders for entering flower measurements

Instant prediction using a trained Random Forest Classifier

Pre-trained model based on the classic Iris dataset

Works locally or can be deployed for free on Streamlit Cloud
